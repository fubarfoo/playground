Lab

My lab is leveraging vEOS.  The configuration is as follows:

Dell R410 server running Eve-NG to host the vEOS instances (currently have a two spine,
 6 leaf and 3 vEOS images acting as end hosts topology).

 The Dell R410 has 2 NICs, one which is connected directly to my home network (Vlan 1) and
 the other which connects to the vEOS switch management network (Vlan 100).  The switch these
 are connected to allows routing between the two networks, but allows me to do ZTP and
 other functions in the lab environment.

 Also in the lab, I have a KVM VM running Cloudvision (Arista's management and automation platform)
 as I plan to look to leverage the API for that in the future to integrate with ansible.

 I'm able to interact with my vEOS instances from my laptop (I have a Linux VM I use for running ansible)
 as that allows a pristine "dev" environment and not having to worry about coordinating virtual environments.
